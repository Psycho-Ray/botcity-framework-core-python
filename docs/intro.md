# Getting Started

After you installed this package, the next step is to
import the package into your code and start using the
functions to build your RPA pipeline.

```python
from botcity.core import *
```

As a demonstration of the library, let's build a simple
bot together that will open BotCity's website in your browser.

## Opening the browser
To open the browser you can leverage the `browser` function
which takes as argument a URL.

```python
browser("https://www.botcity.dev/en")
```

## Template Project

We created a template project using Cookiecutter to help
you create new bots using BotCity's Python Framework.

Take a look into the [template project website](https://github.com/botcity-dev/bot-python-template) for more information
on how to use it and get started.

## Next Steps

Check our examples and experiment with the API.
Let us know where it can be improved.
